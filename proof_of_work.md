## What is proof of work(POW)

Easy Description the Proof of Work

The work of - Proof of Work - prove a calculate problem that is due to add a new generate block. This calculate problem is processing to find a nonce(number used once). This nonce is answer of the problem. This process is called - Mining - .

The proof of - Proof of Work - confirm a right nonce. Miners process this proof without a nonce found miner. A nonce feature that finding is difficult, but a proof is easy. A mining is requiring an enormous calculation, that reason is due to preventive of fabrication.
